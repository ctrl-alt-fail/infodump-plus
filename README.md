# infodump+

`infodump+` is a lightweight Linux system diagnostics tool designed to provide quick, at-a-glance insights into node health and performance. Originally written in Bash and later rewritten in Python, the tool collects and displays key system information ‚Äî including CPU usage, memory stats, disk utilization, network status, and top resource-consuming processes ‚Äî all in a human-readable CLI format.

The goal is to simulate the kind of environment-aware tooling often used by support engineers working with distributed systems, HPC clusters, or cloud infrastructure.

This project serves as both a practical utility and a learning exercise in systems automation, scripting, and continuous improvement.

# How I Used AI to Improve My Bash Script ‚Äî and Became a Better Engineer

In 2022, I wrote a Bash script called `infodump` ‚Äî a simple diagnostic tool that prints out key system information like CPU usage, network status, memory stats, and disk space. At the time, it helped me automate checks in Linux environments I managed at home.

But recently, I decided to revisit and improve it using a powerful tool ‚Äî AI.

## How AI Helped Me Improve It

With help from ChatGPT, I:

- **Modularized the structure** ‚Äî breaking the script into clean, testable functions
- **Identified gaps** ‚Äî like missing error handling or repeated code.
- **Rewrote the tool in Python** ‚Äî using libraries like `psutil` and `subprocess`.
- **Planned future improvements** ‚Äî log output, optional CLI flags, and even a Streamlit dashboard.

## What I Learned

Using AI tools like ChatGPT isn't just about generating code ‚Äî it's about building better intuition. I was able to:

- Refactor more cleanly
- Adopt Pythonic practices for readability
- Learn which libraries to use for low-level system inspection
- Understand how this kind of tool might operate in a real support environment

## The Project

The tool is now available in two versions:
- üêö [Original Bash script](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-fail/infodump-plus/blob/main/infodump.sh)
- üêç [Python rewrite](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-fail/infodump-plus/blob/main/infodump+.py)

## Final Thoughts

Whether you're supporting a production system or just trying to learn, creating real tools ‚Äî then improving them with help ‚Äî is a powerful way to grow. This project gave me a clearer sense of how to support infrastructure, and how to keep learning along the way.

Oh, and this README was generated using AI üòâ.
